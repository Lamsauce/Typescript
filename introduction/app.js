/* ===== WHAT IS TYPESCRIPT ===== */
// Typescript keeps variable types the way they are. 
// For example, Javascript doesn't restrict types to change from one to another. Like a string into an integer.
// With Typescript, it will catch and prevent errors if there is a change.
let apple = "apple";
// apple = 14; <-- This won't work because the variable apple is defined as a string and cannot change to a number.
/* ===== THINGS TO KNOW ===== */
// Typescript works similarly to C programming languages like C++ and C#, although not entirely.
// Typescript was made by Microsoft.
// VS Code doesn't need any extension for Typescript since it is also a software by Microsoft.
// Typescript cannot be read by web browsers
// The javascript file has to be read.
// You can still type normal Javascript in a Typescript file.
// The TS file gives you the opportunity to use its features.
// "var" is sent back because ES5 is the default JS. You can change with "tsc -- init"
/* ===== INSTRUCTIONS ===== */
// npm install -g typescript
// compile tsc filename.ts
// tsc --init
// tsc -w
